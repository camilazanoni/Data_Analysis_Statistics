# Data_Analysis_Statistics

Project developed during descriptive analysis course. Using the knowledge acquired in the training, I performed a descriptive analysis of a set of data taken from the IBGE's National Household Sample Survey - 2015. 
For this, it was necessary to use data visualization tools (seaborn and pandas), calculate and evaluate measures of central tendency and dispersion of the data.
